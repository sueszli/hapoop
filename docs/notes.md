# Submission

`<groupID>_DIC2024_Ex1.zip` must contain:

-   `output.txt`: results obtained
-   `report.pdf`: written report

    -   max 8 pdf pages of A4 size in total
    -   section 1: introduction

    -   use arguments to pass the hdfs input path and the local output path to the script because the paths will change when the code is run on the cluster.
    -   code must be correct, well documented, and efficient (you will have a runtime limit - the best times last term were <20 minutes).
